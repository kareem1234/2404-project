DESIGN DOCUMENTATION  
UML DIAGRAM included in seperate pdf

Although it was recommened to save data into seperate files, we exercised our design skills and output student data into one file
This allows for a uniform variable name across the program where all student info can be written to. Having one file allows for minimized storage space.
Data can eaily be read back in and stored into objects due to the fact all data for one student is written on one line within the storage file.
All data is deliminated by special characters allowing for compound strings including empty space. Parsing is quick and efficitent due to the specific nature in which data is outputed.
Having one student object outputed to a line allows for quick searching for xth student.
