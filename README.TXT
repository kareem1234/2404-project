To run program execute commands:
				make
				./Assignment4

In our view a summary menu for teachers, if all applications are selected to be viewed and then the user chooses to save these to file, they are stored in a text file named All Applications.txt. If a specific course is selected, then if the user saves that data to file it will be a text file with the name of it corresponding to the course currently selected.

To run the queue test program after the make command is executed, type ./Qtest. It will run a series of tests on the queue and print the test output to the console for your pleasure to view.

To clean and rerun the queue test program, make clean1 removes all the related content.

To clean and rerun the main assignment program, make clean removes all the related content.

HAVE FUN!!
